# LLM/VLM Applications in Robotics

This repository contains the report and related materials for a university project exploring the use of **Large Language Models (LLMs)** and **Vision-Language Models (VLMs)** in robotics.
The objective of the work was to review existing approaches, identify potential applications, and experiment with practical integrations.

## Project Overview

The project investigates how LLMs and VLMs can be leveraged to enhance robotic perception, reasoning, and interaction.
Several projects and frameworks were reviewed, including tools for scene understanding, task planning, and natural language-based control.

A practical part of the work focused on testing the **VLMAPS** framework within the **iGibson** simulation environment to evaluate its capabilities for semantic mapping and navigation.

## Key Topics Covered

* Overview of LLM and VLM technologies
* Applications in robotic control, navigation, and perception
* Review of selected research projects and frameworks
* Experimentation with VLMAPS in simulation
